[_An O\(ND\) Difference Algorithm and its Variations_](http://www.xmailserver.org/diff2.pdf), Eugene W. Myers. Describes an O\(_nd_\) \(where _n_ is the input length and _d_ is the edit distance\) algorithm for finding the longest common subsequence \(LCS\)/shortest edit script \(SES, or what people usually mean when they say “diff”\) of two sequences. Intricate & subtle, and with some historical quirks \(e.g. 1-indexing\), but defines the problem exceptionally well. The algorithm’s efficiency hinges crucially on a very deep understanding of the problem, making it an interesting case study in optimization.
