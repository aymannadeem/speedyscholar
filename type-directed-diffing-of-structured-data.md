[_Type-Directed Diffing of Structured Data_](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~swier004/publications/2017-tyde-draft-2.pdf), Victor Cacciari Miraldo, Pierre-Évariste Dagand, Wouter Swierstra. A datatype-generic representation for tree diffs, motivated specifically by syntax tree diffing. The authors note the mismatch between the notion of a _minimal \_tree diff and a \_usable \_tree diff, in human terms, and thus discuss tree alignments rather than edits_. Further, they make use of nondeterminism to produce the set of possible alignments rather than selecting a single one \(since they haven’t yet formalized a metric for usability that would guide a decision procedure\).
