[_Deep Code Comment Generation_](https://xin-xia.github.io/publication/icpc182.pdf), Xing Hu, Ge Li, Xin Xia, David Lo, Zhi Jin. Using a corpus of ~10k open source Java projects, this team created a neural network that can summarize methods and write human parity comments describing them. The team developed a novel AST vectorization for training by representing the tree as a sequence. Interestingly, this encoding phase is wholly reversible making this representation an ideal jumping off point for team's interested in training ML models off of source code.
